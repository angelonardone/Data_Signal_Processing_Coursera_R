The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a signal is defined using the following formula:

$X(k)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j(2\pi/N)(n)(k)},k=0,\ldots,N-1.$

Similar formula is used for the discrete Fourier series (DFS) of a periodic signal.

The DFS / DFT is a vector of complex numbers which can be represented via their magnitude $|X(n)|$  (absolute value) 
and phase $\arctan \frac{\text{Im}(X(n))}{\text{Re}(X(n))}n=0,\ldots,N-1$
